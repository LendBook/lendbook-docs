LendBook protocol is still under construction. It is developed by the Breaking Lab team.

We aim to develop a protocol that meets real user needs. So we're listening to all our future users. **If you have any feedback on LendBook, please don't hesitate to share it with us !**

Also we want to develop a protocol that everyone can understand. **If you have any questions, it means that this documentation needs to be improved.** There are no stupid questions, so **if you have any questions about the protocol, please let us know !**
