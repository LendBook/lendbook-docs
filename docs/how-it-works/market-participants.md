There are three different types of market participants :

* **Lenders :** They post limit orders at specified prices. These orders can be borrowed, which earns them interest.
* **Borrowers :** They post limit orders at specified prices on the other side of the order book. They earn interest rates when orders are borrowed. 
* **Takers :** They take limit orders which are in the LLOB.
