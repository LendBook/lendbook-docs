## **Intro**

LendBook protocol was developed by the Breaking Lab team. This protocol has been developed to **solve two major problems** associated with lending protocols:

* the risk management of bad debt
* the complex borrower experience (hard to understand the debt management).

LendBook was design to be **the most robust protocol to supply and borrow assets**.

**Even if LendBook is an innovative lending protocol, it's easy to grasp**. This documentation is intended to explain in simple terms all the concepts behind this protocol and all the possibilities offered by LendBook to its users.

The protocol is immune to the risk of bad debt, there is no off-chain risk management.
