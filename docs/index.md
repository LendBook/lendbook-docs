<h1>Welcome to LendBook protocol</h1>

LendBook protocol was developed by the Breaking Lab team. This protocol has been developed to solve two major problems associated with lending protocols:

* the risk of bad debt
* the complex borrower experience (hard to understand the debt management)


Even if LendBook is an **innovative protocol** in the lending landscape, **it's easy to grasp**. This documentation is intended to explain in simple terms all the concepts behind this protocol and all the possibilites offered by LendBook to its users.
