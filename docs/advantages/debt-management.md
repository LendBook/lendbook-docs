By choosing the pool-of-orders from which the borrower borrows, he therefore chooses the price at which he wishes to be liquidated. 
**To avoid liquidation, the borrower simply needs to follow the market price and remember at what limit price he has placed his loan.**

<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Check out your excess collateral</h2>

If the borrower doesn't want to over-collateralize his loan, **he can track his [excess collateral](../../how-it-works/liquidation){target=_blank} and when his excess collateral falls below a given threshold, he can repay his loan or add more collateral.**


Alternatively, if the borrower doesn't want to bother, he can calculate the maximum interest rate he would need over a desired period of time, and adds this amount to the collateral he has already deposited (There will be a tab in the dapp to calculate this easily).
