## **What is a LendBook ?**

LendBook is a **Lending Limit Order Book (LLOB)**. It's a non-custodial and permissionless lending protocol that enables users to borrow limit ordersâ€™ assets collateralized by their own limit orders. 

In other words, it can be seen as the fusion of a Limit Order Book and a lending protocol.

This new financial primitive offers users multiple benefits:

The protocol is immune to the risk of bad debt, there is no off-chain risk management.
