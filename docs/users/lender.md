## **How do I supply**

First, you need to choose the asset to supply and the market in which you want to supply. For example, you might want to supply USDC in the ETH/USDC market.

Then, depending on your strategy, you can choose in which pool-of-orders you want to post your asset as a limit order. Indeed, you can deposit in a pool-of-orders close to or far away from the market price.


## **How much will I earn?**

The interest rate you receive depends on the utilization rate of the pool you deposited in. 

+ liquidation fees
